## About This Project


This is a modern web application starter template using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed for fast development, scalability, and maintainability. The project includes configuration for linting (ESLint), styling (Tailwind CSS, PostCSS), and TypeScript for type safety. The main code lives in the `src` folder, with `App.tsx` as the main component and `main.tsx` as the entry point. The project is ready for customization and can be quickly started with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
